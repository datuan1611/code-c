P021:
. Precedence of operator AND (&&) is just higher that operator OR (||)

P030:
. Detect the end of file by check: "(c=getchar()) != EOF"
. When a string constant in C is stored as an array of characters containing the characters of the string and terminated with a '\0' to mark the end.
  The %s format in PRINTF expects an argument as a string that is terminated by '\0'.
  All of this implies that '\0' is not a part of normal text.
  ->normal text: 'H' 'E' 'L' 'L' 'O' '\n'
  ->string form: 'H' 'E' 'L' 'L' 'O' '\n' '\0'
